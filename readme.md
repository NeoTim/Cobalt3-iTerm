An awesome Cobalt3 theme for iTerm2 and ZSH.

Two things for lovers of the [Sublime Text Theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2). Cobalt3 in your terminal!

Forked by [Ahmad Awais](http://AhmadAwais.com/)

`cobalt3.itermcolors` is for anyone who uses iTerm2 and wants the colours. The `cobalt3.zsh-theme` is the prompt layout for zsh users. 

They work well together! You will need to install the patched powerline font as well: <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>

#### Step-by-step Installation

1. Drop the `cobalt3.zsh-theme` file in to the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory.
2. Open up your ZSH preferences at `~/.zshrc` and change the theme variable to `ZSH_THEME="cobalt3"`.
3. In iTerm2 access the *Preferences* pane on the *Profiles* tab.
4. Under the *Colors* tab import the `cobalt3.itermcolors` file via the *Load Presets* drop-down.
5. Under the *Text* tab change the font for each type (*Regular* and *Non-ASCII*) to '**Inconsolata for Powerline**'. (Refer to the [powerline-fonts repo](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) for help on font installation.)
6. Refresh ZSH by typing `source ~/.zshrc` on the command line.

Thank you Wes Bos and all other contributors for all your efforts. Added my own flavor to Cobalt2.
